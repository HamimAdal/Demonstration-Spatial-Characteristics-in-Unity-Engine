# Deomstaration of The Spatial Characteristics Model in Unity Game Engine.
In a real-world setting, the smart space would be engineered to access and control all the devices within its scope, to support the mechanics for interfacing with the user (or its proxy—a smartphone), and to rely on specialized algorithms designed to ensure rapid and accurate processing of user requests. In this demonstration, we will assume a more abstract perspective.  We will take for granted that the space and the user can interact with each other, and we will assume the availability of algorithms the space uses to satisfy individual user requests. Our goal is simply to illustrate at an abstract level how requests related to a specific spatial characteristic can be satisfied by the smart space to deliver the required functionality. 

# Experimental Setup.
To visualize the user-space interactions in the context of the spatial characteristics model, we will employ a virtual space built using the Unity game engine platform, an apartment used to conduct illustrative experiments.  The 3D architectural model captures a real-world apartment consisting of a bedroom, living room, dining space, kitchen, and bathroom. The layout consists of walls, doors, and windows. Furniture, appliances, and other objects were placed at different locations in the space to convey a real-world setting. Smart devices that affect different spatial characteristics will be positioned at various locations as needed. Throughout this section, we assume a single inhabitant of the space.  We further assume that both the user and the smart space share the concept of location.  User requests are location specific while the space has full knowledge of the location for each smart device in the space. Finally, we also assume that, in some circumstances, the space can either measure or estimate the value of a given characteristic at any location in the space while, in other circumstances, it relies on feedback from the user to assess the value of a characteristic at a specific location.

Now, we explore the relation between several representative spatial characteristics, the devices needed to affect their values, and the kinds of heuristics smart spaces may consider employing in order to satisfy user requests.  The goal is to explicate the relation between characteristics, devices, and the space model while offering insights into the engineering challenges associated with building the kind of smart spaces envisioned in terms of Spatial Characteristics.

# Illumination.  

We begin our investigation with illumination. Within an indoor setting, illumination is primarily influenced by artificial smart light fixtures such as light bulbs, lamps, switches, dimmers, etc. It is also affected by natural sources such as sunlight, or external inaccessible sources like streetlights. To deliver a satisfiable outcome, the algorithms need to find the appropriate devices with reasonable configuration, also taking the effects of natural, and inaccessible sources into consideration. Alternatively, smart blinds/windows are also good resources to exploit depending on the weather forecast. The treatment of illumination can become more complex when algorithms start considering the space geometry. The properties of the internal structure dictate the algorithm’s ability to choose among devices. For instance, opaque walls, solid beams, furniture, etc. can obstruct the even distribution of light. The algorithms need to have a clear understanding of space geometry to compensate for such hindrance.

Figure 1 provides a visual representation of how the user pursues a request for the characteristic illumination, and how the space might address and process the request realizing the spatial characteristics model. Our experimental study focused on a combined kitchen-dining space. A typical user-space interaction may assume the user (red sphere has been used as an avatar) to ask for a certain level of illumination at a particular spot, or area, such as in front of the sink. For simplicity, we only used artificial light fixtures with varying capacities distributed at different locations in the virtual space. Six light bulbs were used each having only two settings, on and off.

While the options of heuristics, and search strategies the algorithms might exploit are large and infinite, in our experiment, we conducted a simple demonstration taking the related location of devices into consideration to sort the configuration of devices. The space starts by selecting the light fixture that is nearest to the target location. It continues to perform a linear search through an ordered list of light fixtures prioritizing their minimal distance (heuristic) from the target location into consideration. The search concludes when the desired level has been met by a light fixture or, a set of light fixtures. The background activity of the simulation upon receiving a user request (117 lumens) is illustrated in the bottom left part of Figure 5, where six light fixtures are activated, attempting to achieve the desired level with an accepted threshold of 20 lumens. The final outcome was 104.31 lumens, achieved by device 1 (with brightness level 4) and device 3 (with brightness level 3)
